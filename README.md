l2fp-aggregator is a decentralized system where nodes first register with the contract and then receive transaction state proofs generated by Babylon and Symbiotic Finality Providers. Once more than two-thirds of the nodes complete the signature verification, the aggregated signature is submitted to the l2fp-contracts contract on Ethereum. The contract verifies the validity of the entire signature and subsequently adjusts the fraud proof window for the relevant transactions on L2 contracts on L1, reducing the fraud proof time proportionally to the staking ratio.

**Note**: Requires [Go 1.22+](https://golang.org/dl/)
